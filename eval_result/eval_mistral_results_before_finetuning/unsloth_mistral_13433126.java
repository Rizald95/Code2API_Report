Store the following sentence in String

â€œJAVA IS TOUGH LANGUAGE" 


I would like to ask a user to provide a character as an input and then print the total number of occurrence of that character in the above sentence. Moreover if a user wants to search a particular phrase or character in string he/she should able to search it.

Please tell me the simple way of beginners.
    
Answer: 
  String s ="JAVA IS TOUGH LANGUAGE";
       char c ='A'; //character c is static...can be modified to accept user input
    int cnt =0;
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        if(s.charAt(i)==c)
            cnt++;
    System.out.println("No of Occurences of character "+c+"is"+cnt);

    
Code:   String s ="JAVA IS TOUGH LANGUAGE";
       char c ='A'; //character c is static...can be modified to accept user input
    int cnt =0;
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        if(s.charAt(i)==c)
            cnt++;
    System.out.println("No of Occurences of character "+c+"is"+cnt);

Complete the code as a full Java method.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s ="JAVA IS TOUGH LANGUAGE";
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the character to search");
        char c = sc.next().charAt(0);
        int cnt =0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
            if(s.charAt(i)==c)
                cnt++;
        System.out.println("No of Occurences of character "+c+"is"+cnt);
    }

This code will take user input and
