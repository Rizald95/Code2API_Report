Title: How to improve look and feel of JAVA swing GUI?
Question: 
                
I am working on a project that uses Java Swing. The default look and feel of the Java Swing GUI is very boring. Is there any way I can use a better look and feel? Something like on web pages...
    
Answer: 
You can set the look and feel to reflect the platform:

try { 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


If this is not nice enough for you, take a look at SWT for Eclipse.
    
Code: try { 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

Complete the code as a full Java method.

Method:
```
public static void setDefaultLookAndFeel() {
    try {
        UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

For a more modern look and feel, consider using a library like Nimbus or Material-UI for JavaFX.

Here's an example of using Nimbus:

1. Add the Nimbus library to your project.
2. Call the following method in your main method:

```
import com.formdev.flatlaf.Flat
