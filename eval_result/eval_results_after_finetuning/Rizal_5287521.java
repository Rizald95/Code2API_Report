And how do I put Image on a JPanel using Netbeans?
    
Answer: 
Have a look at this tutorial: Handling Images in a Java GUI Application

At the same time you could code as well:

JPanel panel = new JPanel(); 
ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("image.jpg"); 
JLabel label = new JLabel(); 
label.setIcon(icon); 
panel.add(label); 

    
Code: JPanel panel = new JPanel(); 
ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("image.jpg"); 
JLabel label = new JLabel(); 
label.setIcon(icon); 
panel.add(label); 

Complete the code as a full Java method.
