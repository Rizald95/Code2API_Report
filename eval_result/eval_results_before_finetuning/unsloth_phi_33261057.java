Title: How can i replace double quotes with escape character in java?
Question: 
                
I have such text :

"fullName":"\"Some full name\"" .


How could i replace "" with " ? I tried like this :

text.replace("\"\"","\"");


But i got "fullName":"\"Some full name\". As you can see only second "" have been replaced by ".
    
Answer: 
You should first replace \" with " and then replace "" with ".

which will produce

"fullName":"Some full name"

    
Code: text = text.replaceAll("\\\"","\"").replaceAll("\"\"", "\"");
System.out.println(text);

Complete the code as a full Java method.

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class ReplaceQuotes {

    public static String replaceDoubleQuotes(String input) {
        // Define the regular expression to match double quotes
        String regexDoubleQuotes = "\"\"";
        
        // Define the replacement for double quotes
        String replacementDoubleQuotes = "\"";
        
        // Define the regular expression to match escaped double quotes
        String regexEscapedDoubleQuotes = "\\\"";
        
        // Define the
