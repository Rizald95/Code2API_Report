Title: How to extract a substring using regex
Question: 
                
I have a string that has two single quotes in it, the ' character. In between the single quotes is the data I want.

How can I write a regex to extract "the data i want" from the following text?

mydata = "some string with 'the data i want' inside";

    
Answer: 
Assuming you want the part between single quotes, use this regular expression with a Matcher:

"'(.*?)'"


Example:

String mydata = "some string with 'the data i want' inside";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'(.*?)'");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(mydata);
if (matcher.find())
{
    System.out.println(matcher.group(1));
}


Result:


the data i want

    
Code: "'(.*?)'"

Complete the code as a full Java method.


Answer:

Here's a complete Java method that uses the regex to extract the substring between the single quotes:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import javaaine.util.regex.Pattern;

public class ExtractSubstring {

    public static String extractData(String input) {
        // Define the regex pattern to match the text between single quotes
        String patternString = "'(.*?)'";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(patternString);

        // Create a matcher with the input string
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);

        // Check if the pattern is found in
