Title: How to launch chrome browser from java
Question: 
                
Is there any smart way to launch the chrome browser from a java class? I'm asking because I would like a smart way to launch an application that required a chrome browser on a machine that has internet explorer as a default browser and java 1.4.2 installed.

thanks
    
Answer: 
You can execute chrome.exe like this:

try {
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("\"/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\"");
    p.waitFor();
    System.out.println("Google Chrome launched!");
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


Provided you know where Chrome is installed.
    
Code: try {
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("\"/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\"");
    p.waitFor();
    System.out.println("Google Chrome launched!");
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

Complete the code as a full Java method.

Answer:
Here's a complete Java method that attempts to launch Google Chrome using the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method. This method requires the path to the Chrome executable to be known. The path provided in the example is for Windows, and it assumes that Chrome is installed in the default location. If Chrome is installed in a different location, you will need to adjust the path accordingly.

```java
public class LaunchChrome {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Replace the path with the actual path to your Chrome executable
            String chromePath = "/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe
