I need to use regex, to check if a string starts with a double quotes character (") and ends with a double quotes character too.

The problem is I can't use a double quotes character, cause it gets confused. Is there any other way to represent a double quotes character " in regex, or in string in general?

String s = """;    // ?

    
Answer: 
Firstly, double quote character is nothing special in regex - it's just another character, so it doesn't need escaping from the perspective of regex.
However, because Java uses double quotes to delimit String constants, if you want to create a string in Java with a double quote in it, you must escape them.
This code will test if your String matches:
if (str.matches("\".*\"")) {
    // this string starts and end with a double quote
}

Note that you don't need to add start and end of input markers (^ and $) in the regex, because matches() requires that the whole input be matched to return true - ^ and $ are implied.
    
Code: if (str.matches("\".*\"")) {
    // this string starts and end with a double quote
}

Complete the code as a full Java method.

Here's a complete Java method that uses regex to check if a string starts and ends with a double quote:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class DoubleQuoteChecker {

    public static boolean startsAndEndsWithDoubleQuote(String str) {
        // Define the regex pattern to match a string that starts and ends with a double quote
        String pattern = "^\".*\"$";
        
        // Compile the regex pattern
        Pattern compiledPattern = Pattern.compile(pattern);
        
        // Check if the entire string matches the pattern
        return compiledPattern.matcher(str).matches();
    }
